        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education reform is the name given to the goal of changing public education. The meaning and education methods have changed through debates over what content or experiences result in an educated individual or an educated society. Historically, the motivations for reform have reflected the current needs of society. A consistent theme of reform includes the idea that small systematic changes to educational standards will produce significant social returns in citizen's health, wealth, and well-being.As part of the broader social and political processes, the term education reform refers to the chronology of significant, systematic revisions made to amend the educational legislation, standards, methodology, and policy affecting a nation's public school system to reflect the needs and values of contemporary society.[1][2]>Education reform, in general, implies a continual effort to modify and improve the institution of education.[4] Over time, as the needs and values of society change, attitudes towards public education change.[5] As a social institution, education plays an integral role in the process of socialization.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education reform, in general, implies a continual effort to modify and improve the institution of education.[4] Over time, as the needs and values of society change, attitudes towards public education change.[5] As a social institution, education plays an integral role in the process of socialization.[6] "Socialization is broadly composed of distinct inter- and intra-generational processes. Both involve the harmonization of an individual's attitudes and behaviors with that of their socio-cultural milieu.[7]" Educational matrices mean to reinforce those socially acceptable informal and formal norms, values, and beliefs that individuals need to learn in order to be accepted as good, functioning, and productive members of their society.[8] Education reform is the process of constantly renegotiating and restructuring the educational standards to reflect the ever-evolving contemporary ideals of social, economic, and political culture.[9] Reforms can be based on bringing education into alignment with a society's core values.[10][11] Reforms that attempt to change a society's core values can connect alternative education initiatives with a network of other alternative institutions.[12]</p>
